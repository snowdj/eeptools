\title{Function to calculate the number of times a student has changed schools.}
\usage{
moves_calc(df, enrollby, exitby, gap = 14, sid = "sid",
  schid = "schid", enroll_date = "enroll_date",
  exit_date = "exit_date")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a data.frame containing minimally a student identifier, school identifier, enrollment date, and exit date.}

\item{enrollby}{a date that determines the earliest a student can enroll for 
the first time without being credited with having moved at least once.}

\item{exitby}{a date that determines the latest a student can exit for the final 
time without being credited with having moved at least once.}

\item{gap}{a number, of days,  that represents the largest gap between an exit date 
and the next enrollment date that can occur without indicating the student 
moved to a third school not contained within the data set. The default value is 
\code{14}.}

\item{sid}{a character that indicates the name of the student id attribute 
in \code{df}. The default value is \code{sid}.}

\item{schid}{a character that indicates the name of the school id attribute 
in \code{df}. The default value is \code{schid}.}

\item{enroll_date}{a character that indicates the name of the enrollment date 
attribute in \code{df}. The default value is \code{enroll_date}.}

\item{exit_date}{a character that indicates the name of the student id 
attribute in \code{df}. The default value is \code{exit_date}.}

a data.frame

\description{
This function calculates the number of times a student has changed 
schools, including accounting for gaps in enrollment data. It returns a 
\code{\link{data.table}} with the student ID and the number of student moves.
}
\details{
\code{enrollby} and \code{exitby} are specified automatically if not 
defined. They are assigned to the default dates of -09-15 and -06-01 of the min 
and max year respectively.
